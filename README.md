# Mailman-Mark
Mailman Mark is my first game created using Unity. Mark's goal is to pick up mail from the houses within the neighborhood and deliver it to the local post office. However, Mark can only carry one mail at a time so be quick.

## To-Do
- Add a timer (allowing the user to try and beat their high score)
- Add end game (when all mail has been sent to the local post office)
- Add a counter (showing the total remaining mail to be delivered to the post office)
